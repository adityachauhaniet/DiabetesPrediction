# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“˜ About the Project
This project predicts whether a person has **diabetes or not** using **Machine Learning**.  
The model is trained using the **Logistic Regression** algorithm based on different health factors.

## ðŸ§© Steps Involved

### 1. Importing the Dependencies
We imported important Python libraries like:
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **scikit-learn**

These libraries help in data handling and building the model.

---

### 2. Data Collection and Analysing
The dataset contains information about peopleâ€™s health such as:
- Pregnancies  
- Glucose Level  
- Blood Pressure  
- Skin Thickness  
- Insulin  
- BMI  
- Diabetes Pedigree Function  
- Age  

The data is loaded using Pandas and basic analysis is done to understand the data.

---

### 3. Splitting the Data
The dataset is split into:
- **Training Data (80%)**
- **Testing Data (20%)**

This helps in checking how well the model performs on unseen data.

---

### 4. Model Training
We trained the dataset using **Logistic Regression**, which is a simple and powerful algorithm for binary classification problems like diabetes prediction.

---

### 5. Model Evaluation
We used **accuracy_score** from scikit-learn to evaluate how well our model performs.

---

### 6. Making a Predictive System
Finally, we built a system that takes a personâ€™s health details as input and predicts:
- **1 â†’ The person has diabetes**
- **0 â†’ The person does not have diabetes**

---

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

---

## ðŸ“Š Result
The model predicts diabetes with good accuracy using Logistic Regression.
